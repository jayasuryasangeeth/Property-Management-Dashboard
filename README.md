Property Management Dashboard 

This property management dashboard was designed to address the need for a centralized and easily understandable view of critical business data. Previously, this information may have been scattered across multiple reports and spreadsheets, making it challenging to identify trends and make timely decisions. The dashboard consolidates key metrics like revenue, expenses, property sales, and client performance into intuitive visualizations. For instance, the year-over-year revenue comparison immediately highlights performance changes, while the revenue breakdowns by channel and property type offer insights into the most effective strategies. The inclusion of detailed property sale information and top client analysis enables targeted efforts for improvement and client retention. This project demonstrates my ability to understand business needs and translate them into effective data-driven solutions.
